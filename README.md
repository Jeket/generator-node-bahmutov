## Recommended

I recommend installing [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) 
right away after bootstrapping the project, it will work nicely with the commit message format.
We already include the semantic release badge in the generated README file, so you have no
excuse

    npm i -g semantic-release-cli
    semantic-release-cli setup

Add version back into `package.json`, I recommend

    "version": "0.0.0-semantic-release"

## Test

Change into an empty folder, for example

    cd /tmp
    mkdir test-generator
    cd test-generator
    yo node-bahmutov

Or just run `npm run e2e` (assumes global `yo` install)

## Debugging

Run the generator with environment variable DEBUG set to "gen"

    DEBUG=gen yo node-bahmutov

## Development

Following [the instructions](http://yeoman.io/authoring/index.html)
